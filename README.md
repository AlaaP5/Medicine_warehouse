Project Description:
The "Medicine Warehouse" project is designed to efficiently manage the storage and distribution of medications and health products. This project aims to ensure the availability of safe and effective medications for patients by facilitating seamless communication between warehouse managers and pharmacy owners. The solution includes a web application for warehouse owners and a mobile application for pharmacists.

1- Pharmacist Mobile Application:
   - User Registration: Allows pharmacists to register using their mobile number.
   - Login/Logout: Enables pharmacists to securely log in and out of the mobile application.

2- Warehouse Owner Web Application:
   - Add Medications: Warehouse owners can add medications.

3- Medication Browsing:
   -Categorized Browsing: Pharmacists can browse available medications by their classification.

4- Search and View:
   - Search Functionality: Users (pharmacists and warehouse owners) can search for specific medications or classifications by name.
   - View Medication Details: Users can select a medication to view its detailed information.

5- Order Management:
   - Place Orders: Pharmacists can place orders specifying the medications and quantities they need.
   - Order Tracking: Pharmacists can view and track the status of their orders (e.g., in preparation, shipped, received).
   - Order Processing: Warehouse owners can view, process orders, update their status (e.g., in preparation, shipped, received), and manage payment status (e.g., unpaid, paid).
   - Automatic Stock Update: The system automatically updates medication quantities when an order status changes to "shipped."

6- Favorites and Language Support:
   - Favorites List: Pharmacists can add medications to their favorites list for easy access.
   - Multilingual Support: Both the mobile and web applications support Arabic and English languages, including text and page direction changes (LTR, RTL).

7- Reporting:
   - Custom Reports: The system provides at customizable reports for warehouse owners and pharmacists, detailing sales and orders over a specified time period.
